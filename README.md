# Stroke-prediction---Stacking-ML-models

End to end machine learning model that predicts the stroke risk using machine learning algorithms. Algorithms used are SVM, KNN, Logistic regression, Decicsion Tree and Random forest. Finally i created a model by stacking all the other models and final estimator with logistic regression.

The backend code used in this project is with minor changes from @pydeveloperashish. Thanks to him.
